# Jitsi setup with tokenAuthUrl

This guide is about a Jitsi setup with the following features:

- JWT based authentication on Jitsi
- There is an authentication system which generates tokens for Jitsi
- Each participant (_even guest_) has a token generated by the auth system
- Authentication flow based on `tokenAuthUrl`
- Waiting room for guest and member participants
- Moderator can join directly

## Installation

Assumed that Jitsi will run on Debian 12 VM. It is possible to apply the same
features on different environments.

### Basic Jitsi

Install a basic Jitsi without any customization using
[the official guide](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-quickstart).

### jitsi-meet-tokens

Install `jitsi-meet-tokens` package:

```bash
apt-get install jitsi-meet-tokens
```

### tokenAuthUrl

Set `tokenAuthUrl` in `config.js`. The link depends on how your authentication
system works:

```javascript
config.tokenAuthUrl = "https://auth.mydomain.com/auth.html?state={state}";
```

### Additional config for jitsi-meet

The following features are also set in `config.js` for our case:

```javascript
// disable the prejoin page to redirect the participant to the authentication
// system immediately if she has no token
config.prejoinConfig = {
  enabled: false,
};

// Enable autoKnock, so the participant will trigger the join attempt
// immediately when she comes to the waiting room
config.lobby = {
  autoKnock: true,
  enableChat: true,
};

// disable the lobby password
config.securityUi = {
  disableLobbyPassword: true,
};
```

### Disable auto ownership

Disable the auto ownership in `Jicofo` to allow `token_affiliation` to manage
the ownership correctly.

```bash
hocon -f /etc/jitsi/jicofo/jicofo.conf set jicofo.conference.enable-auto-owner false
systemctl restart jicofo.service
```

### token_affiliation

Install and configure `token_affiliation` module:

```bash
cd /usr/share/jitsi-meet/prosody-plugins/
wget -O mod_token_affiliation.lua https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jitsi-contrib/prosody-plugins/main/token_affiliation/mod_token_affiliation.lua
```

Enable the module in Prosody config:

```lua
Component "conference.meet.mydomain.com" "muc"
  modules_enabled = {
    "token_verification";
    "token_affiliation";
```

See
[token_affiliation](https://github.com/jitsi-contrib/prosody-plugins/tree/main/token_affiliation)
for details.

### muc_wait_for_host

This module is not used in the setup because it breaks the flow for our case. It
allows everyone to be a moderator if she has a token. So, even guest participant
can join the meeting directly if she has a token.

Therefore this setup implement the waiting room by using the following modules.

### lobby_autostart
